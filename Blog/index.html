           		<p>I joined this class because, for the longest time I've wanted to learn how to program but I never knew where to start and I just couldn't find the ample amount of time to do it on my own, so when I heard that we were going to introduce a coding class I jumped at the opportunity to join. Plus this is my last year of highschool so I want to try and get involved and learn as much as possible since its FREE!</p>

              <p>Responsive design is when the content being presented on the page changes its size to fit the users screen. (Ex. Google, Instagram, Facebook, Wikipedia)</p>

            <p><b><h3>Verizon App Challenge</h3></b></p>
            <p>The problem with highschool sports apps is that they don't show ALL the information that you're looking for. Most of the time they only show the score, and when it comes to player stats they don't matchup to how the player actually plays. To fix these issues with WESPN we will be adding a play by play and streaming feature to better allow people that aren't able to make it to the game to keep up and still be able to know what is going on. Also we'll be adding player stats but make them be accurate by doing it ourselves and not allowing the players to "fib" them. We could improve our video by adding in more comments from people who have "used" the app to show others that the app actually does work. Currently we have a player by player, streaming, and allowing the players to make accounts and sync their accounts to the player stats. I'd like to add more features similar to instagram with the layout and accessability. I think the biggest challenge we faced is naming. Next time we'll be a bit more prepared with information to make it easier for us to think of a title.</p>

            <p><b><h3>UPDATE</h3></b></p>
            <p>It's been a while since the last time I've updated my blog but from then til RIGHT NOW we've learned soooooo much new stuff about coding that my brain literally can't handle the amount of information but some of the new stuff we've learned was flexbox, array methods, the difference between 1D and 2D arrays, and so much more that I just can't think of right now. Just wanted to drop in and say what's up and check up on everything but have yalls a nice day!</p>
